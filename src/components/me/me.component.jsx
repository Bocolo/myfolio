                I want to make the world more beautiful, more intuitive and 
                more accessible.

                I studied psychology because I love to understand how things work, why they work,
                and how they can be improved.  And I fell in love with programming for those very same reasons.

                    I have lived in 4 countries, but thats not nearly enough (just a little over 2%).
                    <br/><br/>
                    I love to read, but mostly if it's fanstastical and epic.  If the world is magic, I'm hooked, 
                    because everyone need a lil more magic in their lives, especially these days.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I can be obsessive, but I like to view that as a positive because it means I'll give 110% everytime.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I love nothing more than standing on top of mountain in rural Ireland or swimming in waves 
                    (somewhere hotter than Ireland).
